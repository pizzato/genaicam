    ## About This Project

    This app is a **proof of concept** exploring privacy-focused, on-device machine learning.  
    It can describe what it sees and generate pictures from those descriptions â€” all processed locally on your device.

    The project was developed by **Luiz Pizzato**  
    ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pizzato/) â€¢ [GitHub](https://github.com/pizzato) â€¢ [Medium](https://medium.com/@pizzato))  

    ðŸ‘‰ You can also read more about it in this [Medium post](https://medium.com/placeholder-link).

    ### Inspiration
    The idea was inspired by [Lingcam by Masaru Mizuochi](https://lingcam.mizumasa.net/), presented at [CVPR 2025 AI Art](https://thecvf-art.com/project/lingcam/).

    ### How It Was Built
    - Started from Appleâ€™s [FastVLM repository](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2025/html/Vasu_FastVLM_Efficient_Vision_Encoding_for_Vision_Language_Models_CVPR_2025_paper.html), which introduced efficient vision encoding for vision-language models.  
    - Integrated with [Apple Intelligence Playground](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/apple-intelligence-playground/) for image resolution, enabling a fully offline, on-device AI experience.  
    - Initial development was assisted by [OpenAIâ€™s Codex](https://openai.com/codex/).
